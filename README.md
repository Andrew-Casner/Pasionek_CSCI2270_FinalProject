# Movie Marathon
#### Create a list of movies to marathon!
## Project Summary
### What is this?
Are you ever with your significant other and the topic of "We should watch this movie!" comes up? You normally want to see the movie but you end up getting a list that's so long you can't ever remember what to watch or in what order to watch it in. Movie Marathon can help! It provides you with several informational links and resources to help make your next movie night amazing!

## How to Run
If you plan on working through git, use the following commands to clone and run the program:
* Use `git clone https://github.com/Dpasi314/Pasionek_CSCI2270_FinalProject.git`
* Once cloned type `make` to build the project
* Once built successfully, use `./MovieList`

## Enhancing your Experience
When using this program here are some small tips to help make the experience worth while!
* **Don't** copy and paste links! Instead if you're running on a UNIX system `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `CLICK`
* If a movie you want is the incorrect one, try putting the year after the title.
 * For example: If you use `find Inside Out` it will return the 2005 movie Inside Out, a Mystery / Drama. If you wanted the animated movie Inside Out, you should use `find Inside Out 2015` and it will return the 2015 animated movie!

#### Commands

* `Find <movie title>` Finds a movie, and gives a rotten tomatoes link to your movie
