# Movie Marathon
#### Create a list of movies to marathon!
## Project Summary
### What is this?
Are you ever with your significant other and the topic of "We should watch this movie!" comes up? You normally want to see the movie but you end up getting a list that's so long you can't ever remember what to watch or in what order to watch it in. Movie Marathon can help! It provides you with several informational links and resources to help make your next movie night amazing!
